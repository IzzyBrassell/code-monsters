    <p>Despite their deeds, the (Heroine/Hero)'s name eventually faded into obscurity. While they did manage to take care of the dragon problem,(Pronoun) did so in a way that didn't garner any particular attention. The townspeople were grateful, of course, but (Pronoun) quickly moved on with their lives. As time passed, the (Heroine/Hero)'s name became just another footnote in the town's history. It wasn't that (Possessive Pronoun) actions weren't appreciated, but rather that (Pronoun) weren't flashy or memorable enough to stand the test of time.</p>
