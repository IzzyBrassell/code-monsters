While (Pronoun) did succeed in defeating the dragon, the (Heroine/Hero)'s methods left much to be desired.

The (Heroine/Hero) soon found themselves ostracized, with many of the townspeople refusing to associate with them. (Pronoun) became a target for malcontents who saw them as a symbol of everything that was wrong with the town.</p>
