        The (Heroine/Hero)'s breathing was labored, and (Possessive Pronoun) vision began to fade as (Pronoun) struggled to stand. (Pronoun) knew that (Possessive Pronoun) journey was coming to an end. The (Heroine/Hero) had fought bravely, but (Possessive Pronoun) body could no longer keep up with the battle. (Pronoun) fell to (Possessive Pronoun) knees, and (Possessive Pronoun) eyes closed as (Pronoun) took (Possessive Pronoun) last breath. The (Heroine/Hero)'s legacy would live on, but (Pronoun) would never see the end of (Possessive Pronoun) quest. (Pronoun) had fought valiantly until the very end, and their name would forever be remembered in the annals of history as a (Heroine/Hero) who gave (Possessive Pronoun) all for the greater good.
