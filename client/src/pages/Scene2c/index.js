(Pronoun) leaped over fallen debris dodging fiery embers as they made there, way towards the source of the flames. With a fierce determination, the warrior began punching and kicking the fire, hoping to extinguish it with brute force. However, the fire was too strong, and the warrior's attacks did little to quell the inferno. Soon, the flames grew higher, hotter forcing a retreat. They watched in dismay as the building burned to the ground, feeling defeated and powerless.
